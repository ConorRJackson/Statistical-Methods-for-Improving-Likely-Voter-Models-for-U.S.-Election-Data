# Statistical-Methods-for-Improving-Likely-Voter-Models-for-U.S.-Election-Data

Abstract

The standard Perry-Gallup likely voter model is investigated as an initial analysis on the
2008 and 2016 U.S. election data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study. Alternative
methods are introduced as enhancements to this model, based on the Perry-Gallup
questions. Different respondent groups (age, party, gender and key states) are individually
modelled to observe the likely voter differences between groups with the intention of
improving classification accuracy. All alternative methods perform better than the Perry-
Gallup model with Random Forests being the most robust and accurate. The 2016 voters
are more difficult to predict than the 2008 voters in terms of likelihood of voting.
